(1st step) Purchase a package of Yippee noodles in a flavor that you like. Yippee noodles come in all sorts of flavors, such as Magic Masala, Mood Masala, and Classic Masala. They are sold throughout India and are very popular. If you live outside of India, then you may be able to find them online or in an Indian supermarket.

(2st step) Bring 1 cup (240 mL) of water to a boil in a pot. Fill a pot with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Turn the stove on to high heat and allow the water to come to a boil. How long this takes will vary, but it shouldn’t take more than 2 to 3 minutes.

(3rd step) Add the noodles and the seasoning. Tear open a package of Yippee noodles and remove the seasoning packet. Place the dried noodles into the water, then tear open the spice packet. Tip the contents into the pot, then give everything a stir.                                        Stir the water just enough to dissolve the spice powder.

(4th step) Use a wooden spatula to break the noodles up and flip them over. Use a spatula to flip the disk over so that the other side gets wet too. Next, press down on the disk in various places to help loosen and separate the noodles.                                                   Like other types of instant noodles, Yippee noodles will float to the surface. If you leave them be, they won’t cook evenly.

(5th step) Cook and stir the noodles over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. As the noodles cook, they will lose that hard, crunchy texture. They are ready when they turn soft. There shouldn’t be any dry patches on them.                                                                             If the noodles aren't cooking fast enough, turn the heat up to medium.

(6th step)Serve the noodles. There may still be a little broth left in the pot. You can serve this with the noodles, or you can strain it out with a colander.

Cover and store any leftovers in the fridge. Eat them within 2 to 3 days.
